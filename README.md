Priority level
Reminders
Dashboard with task statistics (total, completed, pending, by category, and upcoming due)


Technologies and Libraries Used

Frontend:
1.HTML5
2.CSS3
3.JavaScript (vanilla)

Backend:
1.Node.js
2.Express.js
3.Sequelize ORM

Database:
1.SQLite3

Other Dependencies:
1.bcrypt (for password hashing)
2.JSON Web Tokens (for authentication)
3.cors

Project Setup and Running Instructions:

1.Prerequisites

Node.js (version 18 or above recommended)
npm

2.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/isamiyamanha/IndProTask.git
cd IndProTask

Assumptions Made:

-A simple token-based authentication is sufficient for securing the task routes.
-SQLite is adequate for local development and small-scale usage.
-The task reminders and due dates are for display only, no real-time notifications.
-Deployment link is optional as per submission requirements.

Challenges Faced & How They Were Addressed:

CHALLENGES:
1.Sequelize CLI errors during migration.
2.Managing task filters dynamically.
3.Styling layout to look professional.
4.Handling task due dates and priorities cleanly
5.GitHub branch mismatch issue

HOW THEY WERE ADDRESSED:
1.Ensured correct config/config.json setup and ran sequelize init.
2.Created live filters for category and status with event listeners.
3.Designed a clean, modern CSS layout for forms, task cards, and dashboard.
4.Enhanced task model and form structure, updated frontend rendering logic.
5.Renamed master to main using git branch -M main
